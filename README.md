# Hnefatafl

This mostly and educational project for me to help teach me the game of hnefatafl and to practice AI algorithms.

I plan to first start with the Copenhagen Hnefatafl rules and if all is successful to add more hnefatafl rulesets then
possibly other tafl variants after that.

Here is a good reference for how to play the game http://tafl.cyningstan.com/page/768/copenhagen-hnefatafl-rules
