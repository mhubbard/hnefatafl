# Tafl

This mostly and educational project for me to help teach me the game of hnefatafl and to practice AI algorithms.
However the current plan is to wrap this engine into a playable website and possibly and android app.

So far I've tackled the basic rules of most tafl games and a few of the board sizes, rules I still need to implements are:

- edge escapes (sea battle rules)
- shieldwall captures
- exit/edge forts
- weak kings (captured the same as normal pieces except when on or next to the throne)
- repetition draws/losses
- no capture draw (no captures in last x turns)
- king moving one piece at a time
- bezerker rules

If bugs are found please notify me via an issue and if you'd like to tackle that bug or any of the todo's above pull requests are welcome.
